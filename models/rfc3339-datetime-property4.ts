/**
 * @type RFC3339DatetimeProperty4
 * The date this [Job](https://developers.intellihr.io/docs/v1/) Update is effective from within the organisation. Note that this doesn\'t affect the start date of the overall job itself. A `null` value will indicate that this Update is effective from the start of the [Job](https://developers.intellihr.io/docs/v1/). This date will follow the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).   YYYY-MM-DD date formatting is also supported, although by using this format the date will be stored as the start of day in UTC time, not the requesting tenants timezone.
